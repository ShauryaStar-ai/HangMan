After carefull reading throught the HangMan.py use it as a refrence project make me a 
dinaoname guessing game 
In which I have all of the game logic and feautres and I get to choose how hard the dinosaur names would be

On top of that if there were be to made changes I should be told will break the workflow or code logoc or cause errors
